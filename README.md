## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require morningtrain/economic
```

## Usage

### Updating a resource
Some resources can be updated after creation. This can be done as follows:

```php
$customer = new \Morningtrain\Economic\Resources\Customer([
    'customerNumber' => 1,
]);

$customer->name = 'New name';

$customer->save();
```

This will update the customer name in E-conomic. You can also simply provide all the new values when instantiating the customer.

```php
$customer = new \Morningtrain\Economic\Resources\Customer([
    'customerNumber' => 1,
    'name' => 'New Name',
]);

$customer->save();
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
